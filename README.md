# My Digit Span
This is my first flutter project that I made. It is a mobile application to test digit span.

Digit Span is a memory test to test how many digits in total you remember in sequence.
The apps will show 3 digits one by one at the first level, user has to click the correct digits in the same order. if correct, next level will add one more digit to be remembered.
